### What I learned

In JavaScript, AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique that allows you to send and receive data from a server asynchronously without needing to reload the entire web page. AJAX enables you to build dynamic and interactive web applications by making HTTP requests in the background and updating specific parts of the page with the response data.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp) - I was able to learn how to write and use the ajax code in JS to send and receive data from the server.
